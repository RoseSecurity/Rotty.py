# Development Plans:

This repository is a continual project to better the cybersecurity posture of home networks (and to strengthen my Python skills).

## Features to Add / Fixes:

1. Use internal email rather than relying on unneeded dependencies (https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.examples.html), (https://stackabuse.com/how-to-send-emails-with-gmail-using-python/), (https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.examples.html).
2. "You're doing checks based on what OS, then only really changing the path to the file you're using. If you do those checks first, and store the path as a variable, you can reduce the code duplication."
3. Polish the program until a docker image can be made and released.
